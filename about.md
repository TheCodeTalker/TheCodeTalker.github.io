*I’m a software developer in Bangalore, Kanataka*. I’m primarily an iOS developer, though I have other programming interests. You can find my up-to-date résumé on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chitaranjansahu). My open source projects are on GitHub . . I curate the Swift Weekly Brief blog.

I’m currently an iOS developer at Xelpmoc Design Pvt.

My interests include software design patterns and architecture, cognitive science, moral philosophy, avant-garde art, and coffee. I enjoy barefoot trail running and body modification. When I’m not working or running, you can find me at playing .

<!-- In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
